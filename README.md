# Regression-Linear-and-with-Kernel-Methods-using only numpy and matplotlib
This includes example use cases of the implementing linear regression and regression using kernel methods, to give users an idea of how to use the code in their own projects.

A README file: This would provide an overview of the project, including its goals, the techniques used, and any relevant background information.

Jupyter Notebooks(training and testing included) : These would contain the code for implementing linear regression and regression using kernel methods. Each notebook would include detailed explanations of the methods used and the reasoning behind them.

Data files: These would be the data sets used in the project.

A requirements.txt file(not included): This would specify the Python packages required to run the code in the repository.(only numpy and matplotlib)


Tests(done in one notebook only): This would include unit tests to ensure that the code is functioning correctly.
